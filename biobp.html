        <p>Hello my name is Benjamin Patterson and I graduated from urban prep high school. During my years in high school. I learned a lot about myself. I was on the football team before the school year started and that was a big deal for me because everyone knew I would be a great football player one day. My high school only had freshman because we were the first graduating class. I didn't have an example of what a student was but I became a model student. In football I became the team Captain in my sophomore year as an offensive linemen. I love being the leader of my team and being the example for my classmates and teammates. I felt better every year because we always had a winning season. I helped lead my team into 2 conference championships 2 years in a row. 
I also found out that I was a writer. I am about to express myself in many ways... But the best way is my choice of words. I wrote a scary story that was so vivid that my teacher asked me if it was a real story. I also was in multiple poetry slams that the crowd clapped and cheered for. I found that funny because everyone else received snaps. I love taking the time and making sure I chose each word the will add details to that would best support what is being written. Imagination is normally know to be used in a playground but the earth is my playground.
I was an intern at T.r.a.c.e. (Teens Reimagining Art Community Environment). This gave an opportunity to be an activist in a community. My supervisor notice that I wasn't like the rest of my co-worker because I pull the conversation back to work related topics rather than what I did over the weekend or the night before. I was chosen to be team leader and I loved every second of it. I was able to speak up when I felt like something was a good idea or when I thought that we should take another route for a better solution. My patience has been tested many times but I always kept calm and kind. I am respected because I treat others with respect and I respect those who don't respect me. Respect is earned and not given. Trace taught me that and I will keep that saying with me forever.
